This will result to potential increase in profit oil by about half'a million barrels. Project Management e By being the Principal investigator for a US Department of Energy project my employer gained an award of $1,000,900. e Demonstrated technical and managerial leadership by putting together a team of geoscientists and engineers to complete projects on time and within budget thus saving client about $2 million in capital and operational cost. e Directed and mentored interns who later landed permanent positions as a result of my efforts. e Trained engineering staff on how to use and troubleshoot Landmark Nexus and Eclipse commercial simulators and so doing increased efficiency of the group by 15%. Project coordination and outreach e Leda team of three researchers to three universities in Cameroon to donate computers and provide trainmg in ArcGIS, MS Excel and MS Access to geoscience graduate students and staff} in March 2014. Appomtments and awards e Appomted by dean of Graduate School to serve as student representative of the graduate council at the University of South Florida from 2007 to 2009, to advice the dean on general policies and procedures on matters related to graduate education and research. e Received the European Union- Greenhouse-gas Removal Apprenticeship and Student Program (EU- GRASP) post-doctoral research scholarship from 2009 to 2010.
